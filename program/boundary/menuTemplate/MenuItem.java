 * {@code MenuItem} represents a single interactive option that can be displayed within a menu in the application.
 * Each menu item has three core attributes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A **description**: The text that is shown to the user in the menu.</li>
 * <li>A **visibility condition**: A rule that determines whether this menu item should be displayed to a particular user.</li>
 * <li>An **action**: The specific task or operation that is performed when the user selects this menu item.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Think of a {@code MenuItem} as a button or a selectable choice in a list. When the user interacts with it, something happens.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code MenuItem} objects are typically organized within {@link MenuGroup} objects, which act as containers for multiple menu options.
 * The navigation between different menus and the display of menu items are handled by the {@link MenuNavigator} class.</p>
